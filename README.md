## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need:

- A modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6.
- Access to the Catalog API running locally or hosted.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/catalog-ui.git
   cd catalog-ui
   ```
   
2. No dependencies are required to run the application as it's purely front-end and built with native web technologies.

### Running the Application

To run the application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can use the Live Server extension to serve the application:

1. Install the Live Server extension.
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select 'Open with Live Server'.

This will open the application in your default browser and auto-refresh whenever you make changes to the code.
